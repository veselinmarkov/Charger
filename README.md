# Charger
High power electric car charger

The AC-DC charger was designed as part of an electric car project. 
The planned power is up to 3KW for charging 160V - 200V car batteries at nominal current of 10A, 15A at maximum. The switching frequency is 100kHz.
Apart from the core switching circuit there are some additional modules implemented, like input/output voltage measurement, overcurrent switch transistor protection, switching transistors temperature protection, CAN communication 

In the current state of the project the prototype is built, all the modules are tested and are working properly, except CAN. 
There are some topics that must be improved in to-do list

The detailed description and the first tests are collected in the overview document.
